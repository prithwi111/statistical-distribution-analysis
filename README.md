# Statistical Distribution Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on restaurant transaction data to understand distribution patterns, skewness, spread, and outliers.

## Objectives
- Visualize distributions using Histogram and KDE
- Detect outliers using Boxplot
- Compare distributions across groups (Smoker vs Non-Smoker)
- Provide business interpretation

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Total bill shows positive skewness.
- Most transactions fall between $10–$20.
- High-value outliers impact average revenue.
- Spending behavior between smoker groups shows similar median but slight variation.
